## Overview  
This is a dynamic Event Guest List Manager built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to interact with a form to add, delete, and manage guest details directly in the browser, without needing to refresh the page.

The app was built to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive UI design.
